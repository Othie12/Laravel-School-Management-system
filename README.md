# School Management System
## About

This is a school management system that could enable schools to automate the processes that are involved in the daily running of primary and secondary Schools in Uganda. These could involve

- Tracking School calendar dates mostly begining and end dates of school terms
- Atomation of the processes involved in making report cards. This can most of the times be tiresome and erraneous for schools with too many Students
- Recording of attendances without the need of bulky registers. This data is stored on the cloud and it can be retrieved any time
- Enabling parents to track their child's performance, attendance and more
- Giving all stakeholders first hand informantion of what goes on in school
